# Advanced Python Programming - Udemy Coursework

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework from the "Advanced Python Programming Course" offered by Udemy, completed in 2020. The course provided an in-depth exploration of advanced Python concepts, focusing on enhancing programming skills and understanding complex Python features.

## Course Content
The course included a comprehensive exploration of Python programming, with a focus on both foundational concepts and advanced topics. Key areas of study included:

- **Basic Data Structures and Objects**: In-depth understanding of Python's fundamental data structures like lists, dictionaries, and more.
- **Conditionals**: Advanced usage of conditional statements in Python for complex decision-making processes.
- **Decorator**: Enhancing functions with decorators to extend and modify their behavior.
- **File Operations**: Mastery of file handling, including reading, writing, and manipulating file data.
- **Functions**: Deep dive into Python functions for modular and reusable code.
- **Iterator and Generator**: Exploration of iterators and generators for efficient looping and data streaming in Python.
- **Loop Structures**: Comprehensive understanding of looping mechanisms in Python including for and while loops.
- **Modules**: Utilization of Python modules to organize and reuse code effectively.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Advanced concepts of OOP in Python for structuring large and complex software applications.
- **PyQt5**: Development of a simple 2-player game, currency converter UI, and other mini-projects using the PyQt5 framework for Python GUI application development.

In the **Advanced Modules** section, the course covered specialized Python libraries and frameworks, such as:
- **PyQt5 Applications**: Built several small desktop applications to understand the workings of PyQt5.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping and parsing HTML/XML documents.
- **Json**: Handling JSON data for web communication and data storage.
- **Os Module**: Interacting with the operating system and managing file system operations.
- **Pillow Module**: Image processing capabilities in Python.
- **Smtp Module**: Sending emails using Python's SMTP capabilities.
- **Datetime**: Managing date and time data, essential for time-sensitive applications.

This comprehensive curriculum provided me with the expertise to tackle a wide range of programming challenges using Python.
